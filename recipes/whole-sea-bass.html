  <h1>Whole Sea Bream with Herb Butter</h1>
  <p><em>"The herb butter really seeps into the fish and gives this classic dish a little bit more complexity without dominating the natural flavours of the bream." - Neil Perry</em><br></p>

  <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
  <ul>
    <li>4 whole sea bream, cleaned (450gm each)</li><br>
    <li>100 ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve</li><br>
    <li>To serve: lemon cheeks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>METHOD</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>For herb butter, blanch spinach, tarragon and chervil in boiling salted water for 5 seconds, drain and refresh in iced water. Squeeze out excess water thoroughly, then coarsely chop. Transfer to a blender and process with remaining ingredients, except butter and parsley, to form a paste. Add butter and pulse to combine. Pass through a coarse sieve, season to taste with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and add parsley. Place on a sheet of greaseproof paper, roll into a log and refrigerate for 2 hours to firm. When firm, cut 4 discs of butter and bring to room temperature. Refrigerate remaining butter for another use.</li><br>
    <li>Preheat a chargrill over high heat. Drizzle fish with oil, season with sea salt and score both sides in a crisscross pattern. Cook for 4 minutes, turn and cook for another 3 minutes or until flesh gives under light finger pressure. Rest, covered with foil for 2 minutes, then serve with herb butter, a drizzle of oil, lemon cheeks and handcut chips.</li><br>
