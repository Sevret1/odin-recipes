  <h1>Neil Perry's shredded lamb shoulder with salted chilli</h1>
  <p><em>This is a light dish, served like a salad. The salted chillies in this recipe have many applications. Use them as a condiment to add extra flavour to steamed fish, or make them into a dressing similar to this and drizzle it over chicken. They'll keep for up to six months and only get better with age. You'll need to start this recipe 3 days ahead.</em><br></p>
